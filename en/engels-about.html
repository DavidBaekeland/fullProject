        <p>
          I am Flo, also known as Flogâteau. Ever since I was a toddler, I love
          to bake. From baking chocolate cakes and licking the pots from top to
          bottom, to making chocolates with a friend after school and bringing a
          giant cupcake as a treat for my birthday. I started doing all of this
          from a very young age. In the sixth grade I knew for sure: I wanted to
          be a pastry chef! Over the years, that hobby grew into a passion.

        <p class="eenAbout">
          I started my small business of home baked goods to go under the name
          Flogâteau, a name my mom came up with. A friend gave me my very first
          logo which I gave my orders a nice 'finishing touch'. From the age of
          15, I took a course in pastery at COOVI in Anderlecht every Saturday.
          From that moment, my hobby became my profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school, we had to think about our future study choices and I
          quickly made up my mind: I had to become a pastry chef. I soon started
          looking for a suitable education course. It was more difficult than I
          expected, but in the end we came across an ideal education: the
          post-secondary training in bakery/pastery/chocolate in Ter Groene
          Poorte, Bruges. I graduated from Mabo in Brussels and received my own
          first professional logo and a website for Flogâteau as a graduation
          gift! Since that moment, I am now a student-entrepreneur.
